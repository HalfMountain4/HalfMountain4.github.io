  - title: Data Driven Recommendation in Brain-Metavers Interaction
    authors: Zihui Qin, <strong>Yilin Cao</strong>, Jeongyeong Park, Qianru Liu, Zhuohui Xu, Nanlin Jin, Hai-Ning Liang
    conference_short: ICSCC
    conference: We developed a prototype system integrating Brain-Metaverse Interaction (BMI) technologies aimed at supporting mental evaluation and therapeutic interventions in immersive virtual environments. I collaborated on designing experiments for data collection and user studies. I also designed and implemented machine learning models to classify emotional states from EEG signals finishing the data analysis using Python and MATLAB.

  - title: Bionic Robots as a New Alternative to Guided Dogs
    authors: <strong>Yilin Cao</strong>, Nanlin Jin, Yihong Wang, Chengtao Ji, Yushan Pan
    conference_short: ICVR
    conference: This project explores the design and evaluation of bionic robots as a potential technological alternative to traditional guide dogs, aiming to assist visually impaired individuals in navigation and daily mobility. I designed and implemented early-stage navigation and obstacle detection algorithms using ultrasonic sensors and infrared modules. In addition, I explored human-robot-interaction and using it as pre-research for designing it into a complete guide dog.

  - title: Robot Localization and Navigation with SLAM
    authors: <strong>Yiliin.Cao</strong>, Jifeng.Li, Zhiyang.Zhao, Yilin.Yang, Yihan Lu
    conference_short: 
    conference: This project focuses on implementing robot localization and autonomous navigation using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques. I implemented SLAM algorithms using ROS and collected mapping data for analysis. I gained hands-on experience with robot perception and navigation, deepening my understanding of SLAM, sensor fusion, and motion planning.
